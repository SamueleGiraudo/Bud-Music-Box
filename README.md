## Quick overview and examples
This program offers a complete language allowing to represent musical patterns, to compute
over them, and to randomly generate some of them. Results can be converted to files in the
[abc format](http://abcnotation.com) and then into MIDI files.


### Main functionalities
1. [Multi-pattern creation](Examples/MultiPatternCreation.bmb)
1. [Multi-pattern operations](Examples/MultiPatternOperations.bmb)
1. [Setting the ambient scale, root, and tempo](Examples/ScaleRootTempo.bmb)
1. [Changing instruments](Examples/Sounds.bmb)
1. [Colored multi-patterns and random generation](Examples/Generation.bmb)
1. [Temporization](Examples/Temporization.bmb)
1. [Rhythmization](Examples/Rhythmization.bmb)
1. [Harmonization](Examples/Harmonization.bmb)
1. [Arpeggiation](Examples/Arpeggiation.bmb)
1. [Mobiusation](Examples/Mobiusation.bmb)


### Complete examples
+ An [example](Examples/CompleteHir1.bmb) on the Hirajoshi scale, played on kotos.
+ An [example](Examples/CompleteHir2.bmb) on the Hirajoshi scale, played on voices.
+ An [example](Examples/CompleteMaj1.bmb) on the major natural scale.
+ An [example](Examples/CompleteHar1.bmb) on the minor harmonic scale.
+ An [example](Examples/CompletePen1.bmb) on the minor pentatonic scale.


## Building
The following instructions hold for Linux systems like Debian or Archlinux, after 2019.

1. Clone the repository somewhere by running
`git clone https://github.com/SamueleGiraudo/Bud-Music-Box.git`.

2. Install all dependencies (see the section below).

3. Build the project by running `chmod +x Compil` and then `./Compil`.

This creates an executable `bmb`.


## Dependencies
The following programs are needed and they are available for most of the Linux systems like
Debian or Archlinux, after 2019.

+ `ocaml` (Version `>= 4.06.0`.)
+ `ocamlbuild`
+ `ocaml-findlib`
+ `opam`
+ `extlib` (Available by `opam install extlib`. Do not forget to run `opam init` first.)
+ `abcmidi`
+ `abcm2ps`
+ `timidity`
+ `rlwrap` (Optional.)


## User guide
This [page](Help.md) contains the description of the Bud Music Box instruction set and
language.

Files containing such instructions must have `bmb` as extension. Given such a file
`Program.bmb`, the command

`./bmb -f Program.bmb`

executes line by line each of its instructions.


## Theoretical aspects
An operad is an algebraic structure wherein elements are operations. This program is based
upon an operad on an abstraction of polyphonic musical phrases called multi-patterns. The
set of all this object is endowed with the structure of an operad allowing us to perform
computations on musical phrases. The main idea is that one can, from a set of small musical
phrases, generate randomly a new musical phrase by computing some random compositions of
these patterns.
